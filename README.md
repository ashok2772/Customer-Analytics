# Customer Analytics

Using the STP framework, I evaluate customer data using various Data Science and machine learning approaches.

To segment and comprehend customer data, I do correlation estimations, standardise the data, and employ segmentation, hierarchical clustering, k-means, and PCA algorithms with a variety of visualisations such as heatmaps, clusters, dendrograms, and scatter plots.

I utilised the segmentation technique to divide clients into categories and obtain insights into their buying behaviour in this notebook. Exploratory data analysis is something I've done before. I've answered questions such as how frequently individuals go shopping, how much money they spend, and how frequently they buy a product in relation to their store visits. For the needed characteristics, I constructed fake variables. I've responded to queries such as which brand each section prefers and why they choose that brand. I've also come up with suggestions for increasing a company's revenues. I also looked into other revenue segments.

Price elasticity of purchase probability and quantity, purchase probability by segments, purchase probability with and without promotion, price elasticity with and without promotion, own and cross price elasticities by segment, and brand choice by customers and customers segments have all been calculated.
